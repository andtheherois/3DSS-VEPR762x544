		<text>The Vepr 54R is an AK pattern, semi-auto rifle chambered in 7.62x54r. It is able to accept magzines from the SVD and thanks to the better ergonomics of the AK, it is easier to handle. However, it has a shorter barrel than an SVD and thus suffers from increased recoil and loss of accuracy at range. This version has
			been fitted with aftermarket parts for greater ergonomics.\n \n </text>
